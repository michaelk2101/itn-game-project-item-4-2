    "# Programming in C# Basics <a id=\"programmingBasics\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will cover basic concept you will need for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "When declaring a variable in C# you must follow the syntax of:\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "DataType variableName = Value; or \n",
    "DataType variableName;\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "**There are several data types in C# however we will only need the following:**<br>\n",
    "**Int**\n",
    "an int short for integer stores a number between â€“2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647,\n",
    "an example of this would be\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "int myInterger = 6;\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Float** \n",
    "a float short for floating point number is a deciaml number between\n",
    "an example of this would be\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "float myFloat = 0.006f; \n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note by placing f at the end we are implying that is a float and not a double (a double is also a decimal just it is a double precision(64bits) where as a float is a single precision 32bits)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bool**\n",
    "short for boolean is a true or false value and can only be one or the other.\n",
    "an example of this would be\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "bool thisIsTrue = true;\n",
    "note when typing true or false in C# it is important to make sure all letters are lowercase\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define functions in C# with the following Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "returnType functionName(parameters)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "to call a function we can simple use its name followed by brackets and a semi-colon \n",
    "for examples functionName();\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loop\n",
    "we can use a for loop in unity to iterate through a list or an array and example of a for loop is\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Debug.Log(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "output:\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "## if, else and if else statements\n",
    "we can use if statements to determine control the flow of code an example of this would be \n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "int i = 10;\n",
    "if (i == 11)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Debug.Log(\"i is 11\");\n",
    "} else if (i <= 10)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Debug.Log(\"i is less than 10\");\n",
    "} else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Debug.log(\"i is greater than 11\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equality,logical and conditional operators\n",
    "In the previous example we used equality operators to determine what i was below are C#'s equality operators\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "a == b | is true if a is the same as b\n",
    "a != b | is true if a is not the same as b\n",
    "a < b | a is less than b\n",
    "a > b | a is greater than b\n",
    "a <= b | a is less than or equal to b\n",
    "a >= b | a is greater than or equal to b\n",
    "&&     | means and for example this would return true \"1==1 && 'a'==='a'\"\n",
    "|      | this means or example this woud return true \"1==2 | 5==2+3\" because 5 does equal 2+3\n",
